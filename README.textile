h1. python-geopy

This is my fork of the geocoding library "geopy":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy.

The idea is to modify it slightly tack on some functionality I'd like to add.

h2. What I've tacked on so far

* An option to return the accuracy score along with a Google KML result
* An option to utilize Google's "viewport biasing":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Viewports system that looks for results a frame you provide (ex. The San Fernando Valley)
